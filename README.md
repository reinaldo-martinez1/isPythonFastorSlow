The purpose of the assignment was to evaluate the impact of utilizing Python libraries, specifically focusing on NumPy, through an experiment comparing the efficiency of matrix multiplication operations using both iterative methods and NumPy functions. The primary goal was to assess the processing time difference between these two approaches and understand how it varies with the dimensionalities of the arrays.
